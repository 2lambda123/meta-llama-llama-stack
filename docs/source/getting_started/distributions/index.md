# Llama Stack Distribution

A Distribution is where APIs and Providers are assembled together to provide a consistent whole to the end application developer. You can mix-and-match providers -- some could be backed by local code and some could be remote. As a hobbyist, you can serve a small model locally, but can choose a cloud provider for a large model. Regardless, the higher level APIs your app needs to work with don't need to change at all. You can even imagine moving across the server / mobile-device boundary as well always using the same uniform set of APIs for developing Generative AI applications.
