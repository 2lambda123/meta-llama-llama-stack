    "[Vaswani et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) introduced the world to transformer neural networks (originally for machine translation). Transformers ushered an era of generative AI with diffusion models for image creation and large language models (`LLMs`) as **programmable deep learning networks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming foundational LLMs is done with natural language â€“ it doesn't require training/tuning like ML models of the past. This has opened the door to a massive amount of innovation and a paradigm shift in how technology can be deployed. The science/art of using natural language to program language models to accomplish a task is referred to as **Prompt Engineering**."
