To minimize the slowdown, it is recommended to (1) use full ``bf16`` training so that parameters, gradients, and optimizer states are in ``bf16``; and (2) give GPU more work per optimizer step (e.g. larger batch size with activation checkpointing, gradient accumulation).\\n* Gradient accumulation should always be set to 1 when ``offload_gradients=True``, as gradients are cleared on GPU every backward pass.\\n* This optimizer works by keeping a copy of parameters and pre-allocating gradient memory on CPU. Therefore, expect your RAM usage to increase by 4x model size.\\n* This optimizer is only supported for single-device recipes. To use CPU-offloading in distributed recipes, use ``fsdp_cpu_offload=True`` in any distributed recipe.

How do I use it?*\\n\\nYou can finetune using any of our recipes with the ``lora_`` prefix, e.g. :ref:`lora_finetune_single_device<lora_finetune_recipe_label>`. These recipes utilize\\nLoRA-enabled model builders, which we support for all our models, and also use the ``lora_`` prefix, e.g.\\nthe :func:`torchtune.models.llama3.llama3` model has a corresponding :func:`torchtune.models.llama3.lora_llama3`.\\nWe aim to provide a comprehensive set of configurations to allow you to get started with training with LoRA quickly,\\njust specify any config with\", document_id='url-doc-0', token_count=512)\n",
